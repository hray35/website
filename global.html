			<h2>Global Impacts Identified</h2>
			<section>
			<h3>What effects can we expect?</h3>
			<p>The thought of the global impacts with Li-Fi is endless.  Today’s world has become dependent on technology but yet there are still fourteen million people in the United States without any internet and 25 million without faster broadband access, according to an article written by Emmanuel Martinez in March 2020.  Before a global pandemic forced people to stay inside and attempt to work from home if possible, it appears that our society has made access to the internet a luxury instead of a necessity.  There are over 3.7 billion people who do not have access to the internet in the world.  During a global pandemic, that is 3.7 billion people who have not been able to understand the pandemic, was to prevent spread, and the knowledge of how to get vaccinated.  </p>
			<p>If Li-Fi was already implemented, it would be more economical than traditional Wi-Fi and could be implemented worldwide without significant investment regardless of a person’s location.  </p>
			<p>Li-Fi does not require a lot of equipment.  You only need an LED lightbulb, a solar cell, and a laptop that can act as a receiver.  Li-Fi could replace cell towers, and radiofrequency damage societies’ health and environments.  People could fly and still use the internet without causing interference with the plane equipment.  Cities could build intelligent cities and use LED in streetlights that could help guide autonomous cars.  Third-world countries could have access to Li-FI to connect them to the world, which alone is worth investing in Li-Fi.  You also have to consider when there is a natural disaster, and cellular towers are down.  Battery-powered LED would be able to keep up a Li-Fi infrastructure.</p>
			<p>As the world moves toward the Internet of Things (IoT), the current 5G networks and other enhancements will not sustain society’s expectations.  As technology leaders, we must resolve issues before they become problematic and with resolutions that assist all.  I am sure internet service providers are concerned about this technology because it could put them out of business as they know it now.  That should not stop the progression of technology but should allow us to forge ahead to solve problems before they exist.  There is anticipation that every home in the United States will have some form of Li-Fi in their home by 2025.  There are also countries such as Dubai that are building smart cities.  I believe that the Gartner reports have it wrong, and Li-Fi is an up-and-coming technology that may have slowed down but will pick up speed in the near future.  Li-Fi will not just impact people, but it will impact industry, governments, and the entire world.</p>
